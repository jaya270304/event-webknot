    c.name as college_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.registration_id) as total_registrations,
    e.max_capacity,
    ROUND(
        CASE WHEN e.max_capacity > 0 
        THEN (COUNT(DISTINCT r.registration_id)::float / e.max_capacity) * 100 
        ELSE 0 END, 2
    ) as capacity_utilization
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN colleges c ON e.college_id = c.college_id
LEFT JOIN registrations r ON e.event_id = r.event_id 
    AND r.status = 'registered'
WHERE e.status = 'active'
